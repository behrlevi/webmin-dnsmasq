<h3>Introduction to DNSmasq</h3>
DNSmasq is an integrated DNS caching proxy server and DHCP server designed 
to run on a host that is masquerading a local private network to the rest
of the internet. <p>
<h3>Configuring DNSmasq</h3>
In most cases, all you'll need to change will be the local domain name. Under
some circumstances, you may want to change how DNSmasq resolves names to
allow for other local nameservers (if for example you are using a VPN
tunnel to another location).<p>
All the functionality of DNSmasq is beyond the scope of this help file - 
please read the man pages!
<h3>Limitations</h3>
Please read the README file.<br>
In Short, this is a quick and dirty implementation with virtually <em>
	no error checking</em>. Therefore, it assumes <em>you
	know what you are doing!</em> <br>
<h3>Use with care!</h3> If you enter a name where a IP address 
should be (for example) then you may need to edit the config file
manually to remove or edit the offending line. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
